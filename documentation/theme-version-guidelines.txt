==== Theme Version Guidelines ====

* Last revised February 10, 2013
* The Opus Primus theme will be referred to as the "project"
* Classes, Methods and Functions will be referred to as "code"


== Over-All Theme Version ==
= WordPress Extend Themes Repository Usage =

* The Over-All Theme Version may also be referenced as the current theme Version
* The project initial public release will start at Version 1.0
* The Version number will be formatted using a Major.Minor.Patch template. Where
if the Patch value is zero (0) it will be excluded.
* The theme Version will be found in the 'style.css' header block and in the
'index.php' main documentation block.
* The Patch value will be incremented if modifications to the project are made
to correct an issue and/or do not change the overall project functionality.
* The Minor value will be incremented (and the Patch value reset to zero) if
modifications are made that do change the project functionality but not its
backward compatibility to previous versions of the project.
* The Major value will be incremented (and the Minor value reset to zero) if
modifications are made that do change the project functionality and change the
backward compatibility of the project with the WordPress core functionality.

= GitHub Repository Usage =

* The project will also be maintained at https://github.com/opus-primus
* The project will be available from the GitHub repository as a means to allow
other developers to contribute to its code.
* The above 'WordPress Extend Themes Repository Usage' guidelines will apply
* Once a Version of the project has been submitted to the WordPress Extend
Themes Repository for review the next modification made to the project will
immediately require (at a minimum) the Patch value of the Version be increased.
* Optionally this Patch value may be appended with an 'alpha', 'beta', or 'RCx'
suffix to indicate the modifications may be reverted and/or are being tested.
* The use of the 'alpha' suffix indicates the code is untested and may simply
fail outright. It is not recommended to use this Version of the project unless
one is very familiar with the code and how to debug any errors that are found.
* The use of the 'beta' suffix indicates the modification is being tested or has
been tested but still requires additional work. This Version of the project is
most likely viable but to be used with caution. This is the logical increment of
the 'alpha' suffix if no additional code modifications are added to the project.
* An 'RCx' where 'x' is an incremented value starting at the number one (1)
indicates: the modification are tested; no relevant issue with the modifications
has been reported; and, final review before inclusion with the project is being
made. This is the logical increment of the 'beta' suffix if no additional code
modifications are added to the project.
* The 'RCx' will be incremented if there is an issue reported and additional
specific modifications are required to the code that initially require the Patch
value be incremented.
* If at any time during the Version suffix is required to be removed due to
additional code being added to the project not related to the initial Patch
value increase, the Patch value will be required to be incremented.


== Function / Class / Method Versions ==

* Included in the relevant code header block will be found an @since reference
which will indicate when the code was introduced to the project. This reference
will be the next relevant Over-All Version. In the case of the initial project
release all @since references will be set to version 0.1
* Updates to individual code blocks will have an @version reference added to
the code header block and be the next relevant Over-All Version. Also, an @date
reference will be added directly below the @version and be recorded as the date
the code was written.
* Up to two @version references should be found in each code header block as the
case may be applied.
* Changes in documentation will not affect the @version reference of the code
header block but would require a Patch value increment in the project Version.


== Text Files ==

* All text files will use their "Last Revised" date as their version reference
