=== Theme Version Guidelines ===
* Last revised February 10, 2013
* The Opus Primus theme will be referred to as the "project"
* Classes, Methods and Functions will be referred to as "code"

== Over-All Theme Version ==
* The Over-All Theme Version may be referenced as OA Version


== Function / Class / Method Versions ==
* Included in the relevant code header block will be found an @since reference
which will indicate when the code was introduced to the project. This reference
will be the next relevant Over-All Version. In the case of the initial project
release all @since references will be set to version 0.1
* Updates to individual code blocks will have an @version reference added to
the code header block and be the next relevant Over-All Version. Also, an @date
reference will be added directly below the @version and be recorded as the date
the code was written.


== Text Files ==
* All text files will use their "Last Revised" date as their version reference
