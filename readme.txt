== Basic FAQ ==
Q: How do I modify an existing function from one of the classes?
Most WordPress functions included with the theme will have their own filter,
otherwise it would be recommended to extend the class and overload the theme
function you are trying to modify.

Q: Are Child-Themes supported and can they have their own LESS stylesheet?
Simply put, yes. Opus Primus supports WordPress Child-Themes like any other well
made theme. A very simple Child-Theme template is available upon request if you
need help getting started. Please email in.opus.primus@gmail.com for more info.
