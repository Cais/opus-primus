== Basic FAQ ==
Q: Who wrote the Opus Primus THA Stanza?
The THA Stanza was written by the Opus Primus lead developer, Cais aka
Edward Caissie. Visit his website at http://edwardcaissie.com

Q: How does the Opus Primus THA Stanza work?
The Opus Primus THA Stanza provides support for the Theme Hook Alliance ideals
by bridging the THA hooks to appropriate Opus Primus Hooks. This allows for
other works implementing the THA ideals to be directly compatible with the Opus
Primus hooks as they relate to the THA hooks.

== Notes ==
* The Opus Primus THA Stanza, although fully functional, is meant as an example
of how the Opus Primus theme can be extended via Stanzas.
