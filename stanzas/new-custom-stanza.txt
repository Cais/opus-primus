REQUIRED indexing file to have the custom "New Stanza" added to Opus Primus.

The content of this file is not currently used, but may be used in the future.

/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
To add a new custom Stanza to Opus Primus follow these steps after writing and
testing the code appropriately:

1) Create a text file and using the ".txt" extension. This file name must be the
same as the folder/directory name the new custom Stanza files reside in.
2) Put all of the Stanza files except the text file from 1) into a folder of
the same basename as the text file created in 1).
3) Inside the Stanza directory, create an initialization file using the same
basename as the text file from 1) and directory name from 2). Make sure to use
the ".php' extension for this initialization file as it will be used to include
the new custom Stanza functionality into Opus Primus.
