== Basic FAQ ==
Q: Who wrote the Opus Primus Taglines Stanza?
The Taglines Stanza was written by the Opus Primus lead developer, Cais aka
Edward Caissie. Visit his website at http://edwardcaissie.com

Q: Where do Taglines appear?
Opus Primus Taglines currently appear right after the page or post title to
readers of the web site. The actual text of the Tagline is entered on the "Edit
Page" or "Edit Post" screens in a "meta" box at the bottom of the page.

Q: Why would I use the Taglines functionality?
If you choose not it use a Tagline for a post or page nothing will be displayed
indicating the functionality is not in use, but if you do choose to write a
Tagline for the post or page you can use it for any number of ideas. A Tagline
can be used to emphasize the post or page title; it can be used as a very short
excerpt of the post or page; it can also be used to provide a relevant internal
or external link ... the possibilities are only limited by your imagination.

Q: When was the Opus Primus Taglines Stanza added to the core theme files?
Opus Primus Taglines was a part of the initial release of the theme.

Q: How does the Opus Primus Taglines Stanza work?
Simply enter your tagline text into the "meta" box at the bottom of the "Edit"
page and the code then outputs this text by hooking into an action filter used
after the post, or page, title.

== Notes ==
* The Opus Primus Taglines Stanza, although fully functional, is meant as an
example of how the Opus Primus theme can be extended via Stanzas.
