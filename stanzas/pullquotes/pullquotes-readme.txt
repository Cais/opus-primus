== Basic FAQ ==
Q: Who wrote the Opus Primus PullQuotes Stanza?
The PullQuotes Stanza was written by the Opus Primus lead developer, Cais aka
Edward Caissie. Visit his website at http://edwardcaissie.com

Q: What is a PullQuote?
The wikipedia definition reads "A pull quote (also known as a lift-out quote)
is a quotation or excerpt from an article that is typically placed in a larger
or distinctive typeface on the same page, serving to entice readers into an
article or to highlight a key topic. The term is principally used in journalism
and publishing."

Q: Where do PullQuotes appear?
By default the PullQuote will appear to the right side of the text being
highlighted, generally beside or very near to the paragraph containing the
text being emphasized.

Q: When was the Opus Primus PullQuote Stanza added to the core theme files?
Opus Primus PullQuotes was a part of the initial release of the theme.

Q: How does the Opus Primus PullQuote Stanza work?
The Stanza works by implementing a WordPress shortcode designated as `pullquote`
with the additional `to` parameter. By default `to` is equal to "right" but can
be set to "left" to place the PullQuote on the side of the content.

== Notes ==
* The Opus Primus PullQuotes Stanza, although fully functional, is meant as an
example of how the Opus Primus theme can be extended via Stanzas.
